Codepath prework Tip Calculator

This is an iOS demo application for calculating tips based on a user inputted bill amount.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

- [x] Required: Added 'Settings' page to select default tip amount which gets saved
- [x] Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After 10 minutes, the state is cleared.
- [x] Optional: Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators.
- [x] Optional: Added dark color theme option to the 'Settings' page and updated default colors as well.
- [x] Optional: Added animation to bill input field to draw user's attention to it.
- [x] Optional: Added bill splits for up to 4 people that show how much each person owes.
- [x] Optional: Update calculations in real time as user updates bill amount.

Note: Encountered issue when creating dark color theme where label colors don't immediately update. Going back to the main screen then back to settings fixes this. Tried various workarounds (i.e., calling setNeedsDisplay) without success.
